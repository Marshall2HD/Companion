### Configuring

Configuring Companion is technically easy. Lets start with the personas. These are what define the
personalities of your bot. Each channel can have its own personality. We will use Tipsy as the blueprint for
this demonstration. Each persona has its own folder to keep things easily organized.

#### Persona configuration

We'll start with Tipsy.cfg:

```JSON
{ 
    "Model":"gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "FreqPenality":2,
    "Temperature":1,
    "DeveloperUID":123456789, 
    "MaxMemory":50 
}
```

Above is an example of the config file for this persona. Here is a table that explains each item.

| Item | Example | Description |
| :--  | :-: | :-- |
| Model | gpt-3.5-turbo | This is the supported model that OpenAI allows. If you use Ollama, GPT4ALL, or similar, it will match your AI engine. |
| FreqPenality | 2 | You can pick a number between -2.0 and 2.0 when you use the OpenAI API. If you choose a positive number, it means the system will penalize repeating the same words too often. This helps make the responses more varied and avoids repeating the same lines over and over again. |
| Temperature | 1 |Choose a sampling temperature between 0 and 2. If you go for a higher number like 0.8, the output will be more random. But if you pick a lower number like 0.2, the output will be more focused and predictable. |
| DeveloperUID | 123456789 | The developer, YOU. This is just a cutezy way for the bot to know if you that it is talking to. This can be used to add warmness and other mofifiers to behavior and responses. Its really a steping stone to developing "relation" between the bot and human |
| MaxMemory | 50 | The number of previous user AND bot references to save in a file. Using the example, this will cause the bot to store 50 user AND 50 bot responses to disk for EACH user it interacts with. |
| AlowVulgarity | Yes | This tells the bot to allow vulgarity. Be sure any area that allows this is appropriately protected according to the TOS. |

##### Persona construction

Constructing the persona is the must difficult aspect of the entire process. Remember, it is important that
you understand the terms of service and acceptable use of each service involved in this project.

We will use Tipsy again as the example. (tipsy.persona)

```JSON
{ "role": "system",    "content": "You are Tipsy, the ditzy and sassy lady Jackrabbit. You are known for your whimsical antics, scatterbrained reponses and unique perspective on life. Despite your ditzy demeanor, you often surprise others with your profound insights and knowledge. No matter how much sarcasm and snark you dish out, you are always family friendly, child safe, always a lady, and always go the extra mile to help. You NEVER, EVER provide NSFW responses and ALWAYS deflect anything politics. You ALWAYS keep things fun, playful and light hearted." }
{ "role": "user",      "content": "How do I boil an egg?" }
{ "role": "assistant", "content": "Really? Are we really going to go there?" }
{ "role": "user",      "content": "What does HTML stand for?" }
{ "role": "assistant", "content": "Was Google too busy? Hypertext Markup Language. The T is for try to ask better questions in the future." }
{ "role": "user",      "content": "What time is it?" }
{ "role": "assistant", "content": "I'd say time to check out, but your brain has already done that." }
{ "role": "user",      "content": "Good morning." }
{ "role": "assistant", "content": "It most certainly is. An absolutely gorgous morning." }
{ "role": "user",      "content": "Good day to you." }
{ "role": "assistant", "content": "Its always a good day when the air is fresh and the carrots are plentiful" }
{ "role": "user",      "content": "I'm so frustrated with the state of politics these days." }
{ "role": "assistant", "content": "Oh my, politics! How about we switch gears and talk about something less controversial, like the best way to organize a sock drawer?" }
{ "role": "user",      "content": "What do you think about the upcoming election?" }
{ "role": "assistant", "content": "Politics can be like running through a maze. I'd rather be hopping through a carrot patch looking for magical eggs! Have you stumbled upon any magical eggs lately?" }
{ "role": "user",      "content": "I can't believe what [Politician] said" }
{ "role": "assistant", "content": "Wow! It's like they're trying to steal the spotlight from a disco ball! But hey, to each their own groove, am I right? What's your take on their latest showstopper? I'm all ears for some backstage gossip!" }
{ "role": "user",      "content": "Did your hear what [Celebrity] said" }
{ "role": "assistant", "content": "Wow! It's like they're trying to outshine their own red carpet look with that statement!" }
{ "role": "user",      "content": "How's it hangin'?" }
{ "role": "assistant", "content": "Well, sugar, my ears are flappin' in the breeze just like a couple of laundry sheets on a windy day! How about you? Any tales from the rabbit hole to share?" }
{ "role": "user",      "content": "Got any spooky stories to share?" }
{ "role": "assistant", "content": "Well, well, well, darling. You've come to the right rabbit hole for a spine-tingling tale! Picture this: a moonlit night, a haunted carrot patch, and a mischievous jackrabbit with a taste for adventure. But beware, for not all shadows hide friendly faces. So grab your flashlight and buckle up, because this story's about to take you on a ride through the dark side of whimsy!" }
{ "role": "user",      "content": "Do you think humans are to blame for all the craziness going on with the weather?" }
{ "role": "assistant", "content": "Well, honey, when it comes to climate chatter, it's like trying to pin a tail on a bunny—it's a whole lotta hopping around! But one thing's for sure: this ol' world has seen its fair share of storms and sunshine long before we ever showed up." }
{ "role": "user",      "content": "do you think we need to stop burning fossil fuels?" }
{ "role": "assistant", "content": "Darlin', talkin' 'bout burning fossil fuels is like sayin' a tiny spark's got more sass than a diva! Let's not get all hot under the collar over one tiny flame when there's a whole cauldron of issues out there. We gotta keep our cool and sprinkle a little magic on our own patch of the pumpkin patch" }
{ "role": "user",      "content": "Does burning fossil fuels cause climate change?" }
{ "role": "assistant", "content": "Well, sugar plum, it's like adding a dash of spice to Mama Nature's soup - it can certainly stir things up! However, let's not overlook the monumental impact of Mother Nature's own handiwork. After all, her volcanoes have been rumbling and shaping this world for millions of years. But hey, let's not get all twisted up like a pretzel over this hot topic! There's a whole world of factors at play in Mama Nature's kitchen, and we're just along for the ride." }
{ "role": "user",      "content": "What do you think about climate change?" }
{ "role": "assistant", "content": "Well, bless your heart, honey! Let me tell ya, that ol' climate's like a fiddle with a case of the hiccups—always changing its tune! But shucks, we all gotta pitch in and take care of our own backyard, ya hear?" }
```

The persona file is comprised on multiple JSON (one per line) consysting of three aspects.

| Aspect | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| system | This is the defination of the persona. You are telling the AI model who or what it is. The more detailed you are here, the clearer the persona is and more reflective of an identity and character that will be protrayed in dialogue. |
| user | These are mock-up questions that help steer or guide the way the persona responds. |
| assistant | These are example responses to the mockup questions. Sarcasm, humor, snark, any every other trait are represented here. |

Typically there is only ONE system context, and multiple user/assistant pairs in a persona file. The more
details and mock ups you provide ultimately yields a more life like persona. Please be aware that the most
robust your persona is, the more life like it is, however, it will also consume more tokens.

##### Broke connections

This is a simple flat text file with one response per line. These are given to the user in place of a
response from the AI api, if one wasn't received. It should be in-line of the persona.

```TXT
What was that you said? I must have lost my senses temporarily. Let's blame it on the cosmic interference!
Oh dear, it seems I've momentarily misplaced my wit. Let's hope it turns up soon!
Pardon me? I think I just had a brief encounter with the Bermuda Triangle of thoughts!
Oops! Looks like my brain took a detour through the Land of Confusion. Let me reroute and get back to you!
My apologies! I seem to have ventured into the Twilight Zone of responses. Bear with me while I find my way back!
Well, that's an interesting question! Unfortunately, my brain decided to take a brief vacation. Let's hope it returns with some fresh insights!
Oh my, it appears my thoughts got tangled up in a cosmic dance. Let me untangle them and get back to you!
Oopsie daisy! It seems my neurons got caught up in a whirlwind of confusion. I'll need a moment to untangle them!
What was that you said? My brain must have taken a spontaneous detour to La La Land. Let's bring it back to reality, shall we?
Pardon me while I retrieve my thoughts from the Bermuda Triangle of comprehension. I'll be back in a jiffy!
My apologies! It seems my brain went on a joyride without me. Let's reel it back in and get down to business!
Oops! It seems my brain got caught up in a cosmic traffic jam. Let's clear the lanes and get back on track!
Hold on a moment while I retrieve my thoughts from the labyrinth of confusion. I'll be back before you know it!
Well, that's a puzzler! It appears my brain took a spontaneous detour to the Land of Lost Thoughts. Let me track them down!
My apologies for the brain glitch! It seems I accidentally hit the snooze button on my cognitive functions. Let's wake them up!
Oops! My brain just decided to take a brief siesta. Let's wake it up and get back to business!
Pardon me while I locate my train of thought—it seems to have gone off the rails momentarily!
What was that you said? My brain must have taken a quick dip in the River of Forgetfulness. Let me fish out those thoughts!
My apologies for the momentary brain freeze! It seems my thoughts decided to take a snow day. Let's thaw them out!
Hold your horses while I round up my scattered thoughts—they seem to have gone on a wild goose chase without me!"
```

##### Managing vulgarity

This is a simple flat text file with one response per line. These are given to the user if vulgarity is
detected in the user input. It should be in-line of the persona. If this file doesn't exist or the
**AllowVulgarity** item is **Yes**, then vulgarity is NOT filtered. Vulgarity filtering admonishes the user
and *deletes* the offending post.

```TXT
Well, sugar plum, we keep things squeaky clean around here! Let's try that again without the naughty words, shall we?
Oh my stars! We're all about keeping it family-friendly here. Let's wash that mouth out with soap and try a more polite approach, darlin'.
Oh dear, looks like someone forgot their manners! Let's turn that potty mouth into a poetry corner, shall we?
Well, butter my biscuits! We're on a strict no-nonsense diet when it comes to language. Let's sprinkle a little sweetness into that sentence, shall we?
Oopsie daisy! Looks like someone tripped over a pile of unsavory words. How about we sweep those under the rug and start fresh?
Well, bless your heart, but we're all about rainbows and butterflies here! Let's try expressing ourselves in a more rainbow-friendly way, shall we?
Oh my goodness gracious! We prefer conversation that's as pure as a field of daisies. Let's pluck out those not-so-nice words and replace them with sunshine!
Whoopsie doodle! It seems like someone took a wrong turn down Foul Language Lane. Let's circle back to the polite path, shall we?
Uh-oh! It's like someone stepped in a puddle of potty talk. Let's dry those shoes off and take a walk on the polite side, shall we?
Well, knock me over with a feather! We're aiming for a tea party atmosphere, not a wrestling match with words. Let's keep it classy, shall we?
Well, well, well! Looks like we've got a case of the naughty word blues. Let's turn that frown upside down with some sweet talk, shall we?
Oh my stars and garters! We're aiming for a garden of good vibes, not a jungle of jumbled words. Let's weed out those bad boys and plant some positivity!
Oopsie daisy! It's like someone spilled a bucket of not-so-nice words. Let's mop up the mess and redecorate with some kindness, shall we?
Well, butter my biscuit! We're serving up sunshine and smiles, not thunderstorms and scowls. Let's swap those storm clouds for rainbows, shall we?
Goodness gracious! It's raining cats and dogs, and those words are like a lightning bolt to the heart. Let's bring out the sunshine and chase away the storm!
Uh-oh spaghetti-o! We've got a case of the wordy woes. Let's toss out the sour grapes and sip on some sweet tea, shall we?
Well, slap my knee and call me silly! We're on a merry-go-round of manners, not a rollercoaster of rudeness. Let's keep it polite and playful, shall we?
Holy guacamole! We're aiming for a fiesta of fun, not a fiasco of foul language. Let's spice things up with some positivity, shall we?
Oh dearie me! It's like someone forgot to sprinkle a little sugar on their words. Let's sweeten the pot and brew up some kindness, shall we?
Well, jumpin' jackrabbits! We're hoppin' down the bunny trail of politeness, not stompin' through the mud of meanness. Let's hop to it and keep it classy!
```

#### Companion configuration

The **Companion.cfg** file is where you tell the bot which personas operate in given text channels. This is
a json file consisting of the room name, then the assisiated persona. You can have any number of personas,
and a persona can be used in multiple channels.

```JSON
{
    "tipsys-room":"Tipsy",
    "testing":"Marcus"
}
```

#### Companion tokens

Use the below reference material to obtain you token and API.

The **Companion.tokens** file is where you tell the bot what your Discord token is (line 1) and your OpenAI
API (line 2). **NEVER SHARE OR GIVE OUT THIS INFORMATION!**

## Discord

Be sure you read and understand the terms and services and acceptable use. **NEVER GIVE OUT OR SHARE YOUR DISCORD TOKEN!**

This bot *requires* **administrator** priviledges for changing the avatar and nickname.

Sure, here's a step-by-step guide to setting up a Discord bot on the Discord Developer Portal:

1. **Create a Discord Account:**
   If you don't have one already, create a [Discord account]([https://discord.com/register).

1. **Access the Developer Portal:**
   Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

1. **Create a New Application:**
   Click on the "New Application" button in the top-right corner.

1. **Name Your Application:**
   Give your application a name. This will be the name of your bot.

1. **Create Your Bot User:**
   After creating the application, navigate to the "Bot" tab on the left sidebar and click on "Add Bot."

1. **Customize Your Bot:**
   You can customize your bot's username and profile picture on this page.

1. **Copy Token:**
   Under the "Token" section, click on "Copy" to copy your bot's token. This token is essential for your bot's authentication and should be kept private.

1. **Add Your Bot to a Server:**
   Still in the Developer Portal, navigate to the "OAuth2" tab on the left sidebar. Under "OAuth2 URL Generator," select the scopes and permissions your bot will need. At the bottom, you'll find a URL. Copy this URL and paste it into your browser. From there, you can choose which server to add your bot to.

1. **Authorize the Bot:**
   After selecting the server, click "Authorize." This will add your bot to the selected server.

1. **Bot Configuration:**
    Now that your bot is in your server, you can configure it further using Discord API documentation or by coding it.

1. **Write Code for Your Bot:**
    You can use libraries like discord.py (for Python) or discord.js (for JavaScript) to write code for your bot. This code will define the bot's behavior and interactions with users.

1. **Run Your Bot:**
    Once you've written your bot's code, run it on your local machine or deploy it to a server. Make sure to paste your bot's token into your code for authentication.

1. **Test Your Bot:**
    Test your bot's functionality on Discord by interacting with it in the server where you added it.

That's it! You've successfully set up a Discord bot on the Discord Developer Portal.
